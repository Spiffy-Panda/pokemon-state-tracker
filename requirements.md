# Pokemon Player State Tracking System Requirements

## Overview
Based on the analysis of PokeAPI, Pokemon Showdown, and PokeCompanion, this document outlines the requirements for implementing a Pokemon player state tracking system for LLM-controlled players.

## Core Requirements

### Player State Data Model
1. **Team Tracking**
   - Store complete Pokemon team data (up to 6 Pokemon)
   - Each Pokemon should include:
     - Basic attributes (name, ID, types)
     - Stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, Speed)
     - Abilities
     - Moves (up to 4)
     - Level
     - Nature
     - Held item
     - Current HP and status conditions

2. **Map Location Tracking**
   - Store player's current location as a tuple of strings
   - Support for Black 2 and White 2 map locations
   - Track movement history

3. **Thought History**
   - Store LLM-generated thoughts and decision-making processes
   - Include timestamps
   - Support for categorizing thoughts (battle strategy, exploration, etc.)

4. **Match-up Record**
   - Track battle history against other players/NPCs
   - Store win/loss statistics
   - Track Pokemon performance in battles

5. **Battle History**
   - Detailed logs of past battles
   - Track moves used, damage dealt/received
   - Track Pokemon switches and items used

### System Features

1. **RESTful API Server**
   - Endpoints for all player state operations
   - Support for multiple concurrent players
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting

2. **Web Inspector**
   - Visual interface to view player state
   - Team visualization
   - Battle history visualization
   - Map visualization
   - Thought history browser

3. **Save/Load Functionality**
   - Persist player state to JSON files
   - Load player state from JSON files
   - Support for backups and versioning

## Technical Requirements

1. **Target Game Version**
   - Follow Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 rules and mechanics
   - Use appropriate Pokedex data for Gen 5

2. **Data Structure**
   - Use PokeAPI structure as reference for Pokemon data
   - Use Pokemon Showdown battle mechanics as reference for battle simulation
   - Store map locations as tuples of strings

3. **Performance**
   - Efficient data storage and retrieval
   - Support for real-time updates during battles
   - Minimize memory usage for large battle histories

4. **Extensibility**
   - Design for potential future support of other game versions
   - Modular architecture for adding new features
   - Well-documented API for integration with other systems

## Implementation Priorities
1. Core data models
2. RESTful API server
3. Save/Load functionality
4. Web inspector interface
5. Testing and validation
6. Documentation
